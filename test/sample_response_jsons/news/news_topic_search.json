There were a lot of people we had, our regulars, who'd go to the hotel but are not affiliated with Trump,” said Jonathan Grullon, a host at the restaurant, told Grub Street. Now, five months after the election, room prices at the hotel can be had for under $400 a night, according to WNYC. Corporate clients have also abandoned to hotel, according to documents reviewed by WNYC. “I have to believe that a lot of organizations would not want to have meetings at a Trump Hotel just to not have to deal with it.”",

					"description": "Recently, President Trump's “Biggest Individual and Business Tax Cut in American History” was released on a simple one page sheet. Rather than looking at how it would effect the average taxpayer, let's see how it would effect Trump. On his 2005 return Trump paid $38 million. But, to Trump, assuming he really is worth $11 billion, it is de minimis. Trump's proposal also eliminates the 3.8 percent Affordable Care Acts Medicare tax, the tax on foreign profits of U.S. corporations and the estate tax, which only largest 0.2 percent of estates.",

					"description": "Along with everything else the election hath wrought, some of the less obvious casualties have been things I never thought I'd lose, like the ability to enjoy purely silly frivolity, or, say, use words without fearing their meanings have been co-opted by another force. \"There are these resonances between the playing-card association and Trump's desired brand, his concept of 'winning,'\" Martin says, referring to the John Oliver bit in which the comedian argues we should use Trump's ancestral name and call him \"Drumpf\" instead of the word so many associate with power and money. \"My instinct is that even though there might be a stronger passion now than with George W. Bush, it's fundamentally about the strength of the core meaning of the word, and the distance of the core meaning of the word from the concepts you associate with the person,\" she explains. \"With trump, you have a less strong core concept and you have a closer relationship between the word and the person.\" Lexicographically, a new trump would be a different word, etymologically distinct, \"but it's not impossible that there would be a verb that would be associated with Donald Trump, meaning, say, 'to unexpectedly win an election.'",

O'Reilly: He is, and he's trying to get our midstream oil pipeline operators to use American steel for all the pipelines. O'Reilly: Being the good old American patriotic boy that I am, I do wonder why U.S. steel companies and component manufacturers don't make these things. O'Reilly: Popping back up north here to Canadian oil sands, Suncor Energy, which is known for being a Canadian oil-sands producer, and Warren Buffett actually used to own shares in the company, I don't think he does anymore. They're looking at deals, basically looking to pick up a few assets in the Canadian oil sands that are basically being sold by other international energy companies that are not domestic in Canada.",

					"description": "The reason the repeal bill is widely disliked among women, rural Americans, and anyone who doesn't spend more time golfing than working is fairly straight forward: It will make health care cost more for less coverage and fewer protections. While the Affordable Care Act (ACA) prohibited insurance groups from raising rates on women in need of maternity and childbirth care, the repeal bill allows states to opt-out of those protections. The new bill gives insurance companies the go-ahead to price women out of health care coverage when they need it most. To make things worse, the GOP health care repeal eliminates essential benefits requirements, allowing insurance companies to provide plans that fail to cover health care options women need. In exchange for eliminating and rationing care for women, rural Americans, and families in need, the GOP health care repeal bill funds a massive tax cut for the wealthiest households.",
