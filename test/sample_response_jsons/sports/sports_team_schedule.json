                      "body": "Since the moment when Kris Bryant gloved Michael Martinez's ground ball and threw across to Anthony Rizzo to end the Cubs' 108-year World Series drought last November, Chicago was installed as the favorite for the 2017 season.   There is plenty of good reason for that projection.   Almost the entire 25-man roster was signed and slated to return for the coming season. The only free agents of concern were outfielder Dexter Fowler, closer Aroldis Chapman and No. 5 starter Jason Hammel.   The offseason is almost entirely played out, and nothing has changed about who is the front-runner.   Chapman signed with the New York Yankees, but the Cubs acquired another first-rate closer, dealing with the Kansas City Royals for Wade Davis and signing Koji Uehara, the former Boston Red Sox closer, as an insurance policy.   Fowler went to the Rockies, but the Cubs signed Jon Jay to share center with impressive rookie Albert Almora.   The signing of free agent Brett Anderson may prove an upgrade from Hammel, who inked a deal with the Royals.   The Cubs filled every hole and also added several starters for organizational depth. The great young core players, Bryant, Rizzo, Addison Russell and Kyle Schwarber, are now experienced and have walked the road to a championship. Why wouldn't the Cubs be the pick?   But this is baseball, and nothing is ever a lock. Some teams spent the offseason \"bulking up\" for a run at Chicago. Others will be healthier. Some will be both.   We've identified five teams that are the biggest threat to a Cubs repeat -- the Cleveland Indians and Boston Red Sox from the American League and the Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Mets and Washington Nationals from the National League -- and explain why they are contenders.LOS ANGELES DODGERS   The Dodgers won 91 games with Clayton Kershaw missing two months to injury. Imagine what they might have been if he stayed healthy. It seems as if the Dodgers' free agents thought that way, too. Several of their key players signed back up even though they had better offers elsewhere -- third baseman Justin Turner, closer Kenley Jansen, No. 2 starter Rich Hill and infielder Chase Utley.   Los Angeles also added second baseman Logan Forsythe and bolstered the bullpen by replacing setup man Joe Blanton with former San Francisco Giants closer Sergio Romo on a free agent deal.   Rookie of the Year Corey Seager should only be better. Right now, 91 wins seems like setting the bar low.BOSTON RED SOX   A significant subtraction and a significant addition marked the Red Sox's offseason after Boston was swept by the Indians in the AL Division Series. Slugger David Ortiz retired after a 38-homer, 127-RBI season. But Boston added a third Cy Young Award contender to its rotation by acquiring Chris Sale in trade from the White Sox. The top of the Red Sox's rotation is now Sale, David Price and 2016 Cy Young winner Rick Porcello.   Boston signed free agent Mitch Moreland to play first base, moving Hanley Ramirez to DH, and the team returns every other position player from the highest-scoring offense in baseball. The Red Sox should get a full year's worth of Andrew Benintendi, who was just anointed Baseball America's top prospect for 2017.   The Sox also made a move to shore up the bullpen behind closer Craig Kimbrel, trading with the Brewers for Tyler Thornburg, who was Milwaukee's closer at the end of last season and had a 2.15 ERA in 67 games.CLEVELAND INDIANS   Cleveland was this close to winning the 2016 World Series, losing Game 7 in extra innings. And that was with two front-of-the-rotation starters -- Danny Salazar and Carlos Carrasco -- unable to start in the postseason and stud outfielder Michael Brantley missing all but 11 games of the season because of shoulder and biceps injuries.   The potential for a healthier Tribe in the postseason is there, plus the Indians made one of the biggest offensive additions of the offseason by signing free agent Edwin Encarnacion. He averaged 39 home runs over the past five seasons and is one of the biggest run-producers in the game. Encarnacion is the highest priced free agent the club has signed.   The offense isn't the only place where Cleveland got stronger. To perhaps the most impressive bullpen end game -- Bryan Shaw, Andrew Miller and Cody Allen -- the Indians added free agent lefty Boone Logan.   One other thing is key: With so many AL Central teams in various rebuilding stages, the Indians have a shot at the best regular-season record, which this season would mean the home-field advantage in the World Series.NEW YORK METS   Top to bottom, the Mets have the scariest rotation in Matt Harvey, Jacob deGrom, Noah Syndergaard, Steven Matz and Zack Wheeler -- but only if that quintet can manage to stay healthy. That's a real question.   The Mets followed their 2015 World Series appearance by reaching the 2016 postseason even though Harvey, deGrom and Matz were all on the disabled list at the end and Wheeler didn't make it back on schedule from Tommy John surgery. None are looking at health concerns going into spring training.   New York also re-signed slugger Yoenis Cespedes, and it returns essentially the entire roster of position players. Jay Bruce struggled after being acquired before the trading deadline, but now the pressure is off. And two other regulars who missed most of the season -- David Wright and Lucas Duda -- should be back, albeit with question marks because of the back issues that sidelined them.   The Mets also re-signed everyone to keep their bullpen intact. Closer Jeurys Familia is likely to be suspended in the early season under Major League Baseball's domestic-violence policy for an incident last October, but setup man Addison Reed has closing experience and should be able to fill in.WASHINGTON NATIONALS   The Nationals entered the past four seasons as a reasonable choice to win the World Series because of the vast talent on the roster. This year is no different, though the window for them to win is growing smaller with the impending free agency of the Bryce Harper and Daniel Murphy two seasons away.   The Nats have an impressive rotation with 2016 Cy Young winner Max Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg and Tanner Roark followed by Gio Gonzalez at No. 4. They added a great table-setter by trading with the White Sox for leadoff man and center fielder Adam Eaton. It makes the batting order very long with Jayson Werth and Ryan Zimmerman potentially batting seventh and eighth respectively.   There is one issue, though, that still may need to be addressed. Washington did not re-sign or replace closer Mark Melancon after the free agent signed with San Francisco. Shawn Kelley goes into spring training as the favorite for the ninth-inning role. The Nationals should have a chance to make a deal, but they need to shore up the back of their bullpen to reach their potential.",

                      "body": "PHOENIX -- Dave Dombrowski must take a vow to outdo himself every winter.   The baseball executive made some of the boldest moves in recent offseasons during his time in Detroit and Boston, and nothing changed this winter.   The man who acquired Miguel Cabrera, Max Scherzer and Yoenis Cespedes for the Tigers and David Price and Craig Kimbrel in his first season with Boston in 2015 juiced up the Red Sox's pitching staff by adding another ace, Chris Sale, the most sought-after trade chip in the winter market.   To a rotation that includes Cy Young (2016 winner Rick Porcello) and Cy Old (Price, 2012), add Cy-to-be. Sale finished in the top five of the AL Cy Young race in each of the past four seasons with the Chicago White Sox while averaging 13 victories, 30 starts, 206 innings and 235 strikeouts.   And the AL East sighs.   Dombrowski, the president of baseball operations in Boston, spent prospects to make the deal, just as he did to land Kimbrel from the San Diego Padres before the start of the 2016 season, taking advantage of Boston's solid drafting and international scouting.   The minors are there to support the major league team, and if that means swapping potential for proven performance, Dombrowski is all in.   The Red Sox will miss the retired David Ortiz, but Sale's arrival should soften the blow for a team that won 93 games but fell in the first round of the playoffs to the Cleveland Indians a year ago.   Other teams are hoping their new additions will help them just as much. Here is a look at the most notable old faces in new places:Edwin Encarnacion, Cleveland Indians   Wondering how Encarnacion's power will play away from the Rogers Centre? Don't. Cleveland's Progressive Field rated as a better hitters' park than the Rogers Centre in both 2015 and 2016, so there is every reason Encarnacion's averages the last four years -- 39 homers, 110 RBIs -- should continue. He was the most productive free agent bat on the market and was said to have preferred staying in Toronto, but when the relationship broke down early in the signing period, Cleveland swooped in.Mark Melancon, San Francisco Giants   The Giants, who made a play for Melancon at the 2016 trade deadline, finally got their man this winter. Melancon was not the sexiest closer in a market that included Kenley Jansen and Aroldis Chapman, but his resume is just a strong -- 33, 51 and 47 saves with a 1.93 ERA the last three seasons. Melancon's ground-ball ratio is well above major league average, and he and is consistent. He failed on 10 save chances the past three years combined. Santiago Casilla blew nine last year.Dexter Fowler, St. Louis Cardinals   There was a not a better fit in free agency than Fowler and St. Louis. The Cardinals needed exactly what Fowler brings, a quality center fielder and a leadoff man. Fowler ranks in top five in the majors in on-base percentage among leadoff hitters since his first full season in Colorado in 2009. Fowler's defense took a major step forward last year when he played a little deeper in center last season. He was credited with 16 runs \"saved\" over the average center fielder.Ian Desmond, Colorado Rockies   Desmond may have been the most creative sign of the offseason, in as much as Colorado plans to play him at first base, a spot he has never played. But if a player can man shortstop and center field, his athleticism qualifies for any spot. Desmond's bat will thicken what looks like a killer offense. He averaged 22 homers, 78 RBIs and 20 stolen bases over the past five years, the first four as Washington's shortstop and the last as Texas' center fielder.Carlos Beltran, Houston Astros   Houston dipped into its history to add a veteran bat by signing Beltran to a one-year, $16 million deal. Beltran helped push Houston into the playoffs in his three months there in 2004, and he was the star of the postseason with eight homers and 14 RBIs in 12 games, a springboard to a seven-year, $119 million deal with the Mets. Beltran will turn 40 in April, but he seems ageless after a 29-homer season with the Yankees and the Rangers a year ago.Wade Davis, Chicago Cubs   How do you replace Chapman? You could do it with a guy who has even better numbers. New closer Davis was nothing short of superb as a setup man-turned-closer in Kansas City the past three seasons. Davis is 19-4 with 47 saves and a 1.18 ERA in 185 relief appearances since the start of 2014. He averaged 11.5 strikeouts while giving up 5.1 hits per nine innings in that run, and he produced a 0.36 postseason ERA as a Royal. The ninth inning remains in good hands.Logan Forsythe, Los Angeles Dodgers   It took the Dodgers all of the offseason, but they finally landed their second base upgrade, acquiring Forsythe in a deal with Tampa Bay that cost frontline pitching prospect Jose De Leon, who averaged 12.1 strikeouts per nine innings in his four minor league seasons. Forsythe leads with his bat and will add pop to an offense that was squarely in the middle of the pack a year ago. He has 37 homers since becoming a regular in 2015 but is considered a below-average defensive second baseman.Kendrys Morales, Toronto Blue Jays   Throw out the 2014 season, when Morales' numbers dipped because a contract holdout that caused him to miss much of spring training. Morales resurrected his career with 52 homers and 199 RBIs in the last two seasons in Kansas City. The Blue Jays found an acceptable alternative to the departed Encarnacion for about half the price, three years and $33 million. Morales regained the form he showed before a devastating knee injury in 2010, and will he slot right into the cleanup spot.Mike Napoli, Texas Rangers   Another ideal free agent fit, although it took the sides awhile to get there. Napoli set career highs with 34 homers, 101 RBIs and 645 plate appearances with Cleveland last season, his age-34 season, an indication he is as \"hitterish\" as ever. In his previous two seasons with Texas, he had 30 and 24 homers in 2011 and 2012, respectively. More of a platoon player then, Napoli will be an everyday guy at first base and designated hitter this time.",

                      "body": "Free-agent pitcher Nathan Eovaldi is not expected to pitch this season as he recovers from Tommy John surgery, but he and the Tampa Bay Rays nonetheless agreed to a one-year, $2 million deal, multiple media outlets reported Sunday.   A key component of the deal, considering Eovaldi's health status, is that it includes a club option for the 2018 season.   Eovaldi, a right-hander who turns 27 on Monday, spent the past two seasons with the New York Yankees.   Last season, Eovaldi was 9-8 with a 4.76 ERA in 24 appearances, including 21 starts. In his six years in the major leagues, Eovaldi is 38-46 with a 4.12 ERA.   Elbow injuries ended his 2016 season in August, and he needed surgery on his pitching elbow to repair a torn flexor tendon and partially torn ulnar collateral ligament.   The Rays are expected to put Eovaldi on the 40-man roster and then move him to the 60-day disabled list.   Earlier, Tampa Bay signed free-agent catcher Wilson Ramos, who is recovering after tearing the ACL in his right knee for the second time. Ramos may not play until June.",

                      "body": "The Cincinnati Reds sent second baseman Brandon Phillips to the Atlanta Braves as part of a three-player trade, the teams announced Sunday.    In exchange for Phillips, the Reds received left-handed pitcher Andrew McKirahan and right-hander Carlos Portuondo.   Phillips, 35, is in the final year of a six-year, $72.5 million extension that he signed in 2012. The Reds will pay all but $1 million of the $14 million salary owed to Phillips, according to reports.   \"We are excited to add Brandon Phillips to our club.\" Braves general manager John Coppolella said in a statement. \"He is a Gold Glove-caliber defender who will also deepen our offensive lineup. We are thrilled to 'welcome home' Brandon to Atlanta, where he will play in front of his family and friends and many of his fans.\"   Phillips, a 15-year major league veteran, has played the last 11 seasons in Cincinnati. He is a three-time All-Star and has won four Gold Gloves.   In 2016, Phillips hit .291 with 11 home runs and 64 RBIs in 141 games. He is a career .275 hitter with 197 homers and 889 RBIs.   \"We appreciate Brandon's contributions to our organization,\" Reds general manager Dick Williams said. \"He excited our fan base and was an important part of several seasons of winning Reds baseball. We wish him well with this next opportunity.\"   The Braves wanted Phillips partially due to a left shoulder injury sustained by infielder Sean Rodriguez in a car accident on Jan. 28, according to Fox Sports. Rodriguez will have surgery and is reportedly expected to be out between three and five months.   Phillips waived his no-trade rights to approve the trade to Atlanta. The Braves' GM issued a second statement on Sunday clarifying Phillips' standing with the team.   \"Since John Schuerholz took over as GM in 1991, we have never granted no-trade provisions and we have no intention of changing that policy,\" Coppolella said, adding that \"teams are obligated to honor the contract of players they trade for. \"We will honor Brandon's limited no-trade clause because we are bound to honor the contract provision just as we are bound to honor other contract terms whenever we trade for a player. If Brandon would happen to be traded from the Braves to another team, he would receive a $500,000 assignment bonus. It should be noted that we never included no-trade or limited-trade provisions for players such as Hall of Famers Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz, as well as future Hall of Famers Chipper Jones, Fred McGriff and Andruw Jones, and we have no intention to include these provisions in the future.\"   McKirahan, 27, appeared in 27 games in relief for the Braves in 2015, posting a 5.93 ERA in 27 1/3 innings. He had Tommy John surgery in 2012 and again last year.   Portuondo is a 29-year-old Cuban who signed with the Braves as a free agent in February 2016. His only American experience is 17 appearances and one start between Class A and Triple-A in 2016, going 2-1 with a 3.63 ERA.",

                      "body": "The Atlanta Braves are close to landing three-time All-Star second baseman Brandon Phillips from the Cincinnati Reds, Fox Sports reported Saturday night.   Phillips reportedly waived his no-trade clause Saturday. The Atlanta-area native refused to waive it earlier in the offseason when the Reds and Braves agreed to a deal.   Phillips tweeted the following on Saturday night: \"What a day lol! #BackInDaTrap #ATLien.\"   Phillips, 35, is due to make $14 million this season in the final year of a six-year, $72.5 million contract. He must pass a physical with the Braves before any transaction can become official.   It wasn't immediately known whom the Reds will receive in the trade.   Phillips batted .291 with 11 homers and 64 RBIs last season. He is a .275 career hitter with 197 homers, 889 RBIs and 198 stolen bases in parts of 15 major league seasons with the Cleveland Indians (2002-05) and the Reds.   Atlanta's urgency to make another run at acquiring Phillips increased when infielder Sean Rodriguez was injured in a car accident in late January.

                      "body": "PHOENIX -- Mookie Betts in 2016.   Bryce Harper in 2015.   Players break out all the time, and this year will be no different.   Naming names is the most difficult part.   Maybe it a player returning to form from an injury. Medical science and the latest rehabilitation tools are remarkable things.   Or a prospect turning his strong initial showing into an everyday occurrence.   Who has adjusted his hitting approach in the offseason?   Who has added or perfected another pitch?   We will find out soon enough. Here is a look at the spring training player to watch for all 30 teams.AMERICAN LEAGUE WESTHouston Astros   Carlos Beltran made his bones in his first stint in Houston in 2004, when he helped the Astros to the NL playoffs after being acquired from Kansas City in June. Beltran made his money after hitting eight postseason homers, signing a seven-year, $119 million deal with the Mets. He returns to the Astros to help fuel another playoff run.Los Angeles Angels   Cameron Maybin is the kind of player who could flourish in Mike Scioscia's system. Maybin recorded 40, 26 and 23 stolen bases in the three seasons in which he played at least 125 games, and Scioscia likes little ball. Maybin slashed a career-high .315/.383/.418 in 94 games with Detroit last year.Oakland A's   Sonny Gray's forearm injury not only limited him to 22 starts and caused a career-high 5.69 ERA last year, but it also deprived the A's of their most dependable starting pitcher. Oakland used 14 starters last year, all of whom made at least five starts. Gray is healthy now, and the A's need him.Seattle Mariners   Since his 19-win 2009 season, Felix Hernandez has been ridden hard and put away wet. Is it catching up to him. He averaged more than 226 innings in the next six seasons after that before a 2016 calf injury limited him to 25 starts, 153 innings and a 3.82 ERA, his highest mark in a decade. How will be recover?Texas Rangers   Jonathan Lucroy identified the Rangers as the best fit for his present and future at the trade deadline last July when he refused a trade to Cleveland, and he was right in the short term, producing 11 homers, 31 RBIs, a .885 OPS in 47 games with the Rangers. His presence all year will be another plus.AMERICAN LEAGUE CENTRALChicago White Sox   Left-hander Jose Quintana has become the de facto ace of the staff after Chris Sale's departure, and he deserves it. Quintana has not missed a start in four years, and he owns a 3.35 ERA and a 1.22 WHIP in that span, good numbers that look even better a hitter's park. It is no wonder teams are after him.Cleveland Indians   Carlos Carrasco really is not fair. His four-pitch mix begins with a 94 mph fastball and includes a slider that according to Fangraphs was one of top eight pitches in getting swinging strikes and ground balls. Terry Francona's brilliant postseason use of Andrew Miller masked Carrasco's absence because of a fractured hand, but Carrasco is healthy again.Detroit Tigers   Wife Kate Upton was right, Justin Verlander was cheated out of the 2016 AL Cy Young Award after a 16-win, 254-strikeout season. Verlander, who turns 34 on Feb. 20, remains the ace of a staff that needs everything it can get out of him. He has subtly changed his repertoire with a little more slider and a little changeup.Kansas City Royals   The Royals had success in resurrecting Kendrys Morales' career, and now they are betting on the upside of Jorge Soler. The right fielder was acquired from the Cubs over the winter for 2018 free-agent-to-be Wade Davis, one of those offseason deals small-market clubs must make. Soler homered once every 19 at-bats last year.Minnesota Twins   Top prospect Byron Buxton, the 2012 No. 2 overall draft pick, has yet to make the splash scouts predicted, which goes to the perils of scouting and the difficulty of the game at the highest level. However, Buxton's power/speed tools have not gone away, and he may be poised to break out in his age-23 season.AMERICAN LEAGUE EASTBaltimore Orioles   Mark Trumbo hit a major-league-high 47 homers last year in a park that suited him perfectly, and it seemed like the perfect jumping off point into free agency. The market did not respond, leaving him little choice but to return for $37.5 million over three years. How will he respond?Boston Red Sox   Pablo Sandoval is penciled in as the Red Sox's starting third baseman entering spring training. Yes, that Sandoval, the one who disappointed in 2015 after signing a five-year, $95 million free agent deal and then missed almost all of last year with a shoulder injury. On the positive side, he can hit, and he is reported to be in shape.New York Yankees   Catcher Gary Sanchez blew up after being promoted in early August, hitting 11 homers in a 15-game span and 20 homers in 53 games overall. The Yankees believe in him, trading Brian McCann in the offseason, and Sanchez worked on his strength during the winter in order to sustain over a full season.Tampa Bay Rays   Matt Duffy was a stealth star in San Francisco's 2014 World Series win, flashing power and a plus glove at third base while finishing second in the Rookie of the Year voting. The principal return for Matt Moore at last year's deadline, Duffy should fit at shortstop, where he spent most of his minor league career.Toronto Blue Jays   Put Devon Travis's first two injury-hampered seasons together and you have a very workable second baseman -- 46 doubles, 19 homers and 85 RBIs in 163 games. Shoulder and issues limited him 2015-16, and he was forced out of the AL Championship Series with a knee injury. Healthy, he enters spring as the top choice to hit leadoff.NATIONAL LEAGUE WESTArizona Diamondbacks   The D-backs opted to scapegoat general manager Dave Stewart and manager Chip Hale for their 2016 struggles, but the late spring injury to A.J. Pollock was the more appropriate culprit. A two-way producer who ranked sixth in the majors in WAR in 2015, Pollock is back after playing only 12 games last year.Colorado Rockies   Rookie shortstop Trevor Story was a walking history lesson last year, tying major league records with 10 homers in April and 10 homers in his first 21 games. Thumb surgery cost him the final two months of the season after he hit 27 dingers in 97 games. He is healthy again, but that will be a tough act to follow.Los Angeles Dodgers   Justin Turner knew exactly how to handle a contract year, setting career marks in virtually every offensive category -- 34 doubles, 27 homers, 90 RBIs -- in his first season as a regular. The Dodgers have to algorithms to believe he can do it again, and they gave him a four-year, $64 million deal as proof.San Diego Padres   The most intriguing name in a mostly retread rotation is right-hander Luis Perdomo, who was thrown into the fire in his age-23 season after joining the Padres in a roundabout Rule 5 move. He throws 94 mph and showed progress after moving into the rotation for good in mid-June.San Francisco Giants   Hunter Pence missed only two games from 2012-14 before injuries limited him the past two seasons. The Giants are solid on offense but not particularly overpowering, and they need Pence's middle-of-the-order bat to be at their best. At 33, it remains to be seen if injuries will persist.NATIONAL LEAGUE CENTRALChicago Cubs   Kyle Schwarber was the feel-good story of the World Series when he returned from a devastating leg injury in time to serve as a designated hitter in the games at Cleveland. Schwarber brings another big bat to a talented roster and another malleable piece for manager Joe Maddon.Cincinnati Reds   A starter in 2015, Cuban free agent Raisel Iglesias was used out in the bullpen when he returned from injury last June after missing two months. He converted six of eight save opportunities when asked to close in August, and he has the stuff to keep the role.Milwaukee Brewers   Right-hander Zach Davies is not physically overpowering at 6 feet, 155 pounds, and his fastball rarely passes 90 mph. However, he has extraordinary command of a four-pitch mix -- the best command in baseball in 2016, according to Baseball Prospectus. He could be ready to take another step up the rotation.Pittsburgh Pirates   Right fielder Gregory Polanco is so athletic -- 6-foot-5, 235 pounds -- it is scary, and he put it all to use in a breakout 2016 season with 34 doubles, 22 homers, 86 RBIs and 17 stolen bases in his age-24 season. A 30-30 season and superstardom await.St. Louis Cardinals   Right-hander Michael Wacha is the Cardinals' nominal No. 5 starter for now, and he has the resume to validate his choice after a 17-victory 2015, his only healthy season in the past three. However, top prospect Alex Reyes is waiting in the wings, and it may be only a matter of time ...NATIONAL LEAGUE EASTAtlanta Braves   Shortstop Dansby Swanson was everything Atlanta believed he would be in his first dip in the major league pool last season, slashing .302/.361/.442 with seven doubles and three homers in 38 games after an August promotion. The first overall pick in the 2015 has All-Star written all over him.Miami Marlins   Right-hander Dan Straily was solid in an under-the-radar manner after the 2016 All-Star break. He won eight of his last 10 decisions and gave up more than three runs only once in 15 second-half starts. On the season, he allowed three or fewer hits in 11 starts, tied for the major league lead.New York Mets   Jose Reyes rehabilitated himself after rejoining the Mets following a two-month suspension last summer, hitting eight homers and stealing nine bases in 60 games. But he played third base, and David Wright is back after missing the better part of two seasons with back issues. How will that play out?Philadelphia Phillies   Shortstop Freddy Galvis was a power hitter and a plus defender in his second season as a regular in 2016, when he hit 20 homers, equaling the number from his first four seasons combined. Which begs the question, what do the Phils do when J.P.

Harvey suffered from thoracic outlet syndrome last year and had not pitched in a game since undergoing surgery to remove a rib in July.   The St. Louis Cardinals scored four runs against Harvey in 1 2/3 innings Sunday in a spring training game at First Data Field in Port St. Lucie, Fla.   Even though he struggled with his fastball command and decreased velocity, Harvey was pleased.   \"Obviously it's been eight months since I played against another team. The biggest thing was going out there and trying, I guess get my mechanics back against another team,\" Harvey told reporters after his outing. \"Today was kind of the first step getting my feet wet in game action and I felt it went pretty well.\"   Harvey allowed a three-run homer and was pulled after getting two outs in the second inning. He struck out three and threw 39 pitches, topping out at 94 mph with his fastball.   In his second season back from Tommy John surgery in 2016 before being shut down, Harvey went 4-10 with a 4.86 ERA in 17 starts. Overall for his career, Harvey is 29-28 with a 2.94 ERA in 82 starts.   --St. Louis Cardinals right-hander Trevor Rosenthal was scratched from Monday's scheduled spring training start against the Minnesota Twins with tightness in his latissimus muscle near his pitching arm.   Rosenthal felt soreness in that area following a one-inning stint against the Washington Nationals on Friday.   \"He's going to need a couple days,\" manager Mike Matheny said of Rosenthal, who came to the majors as a starter before transitioning to the bullpen.   Rosenthal posted a 2-4 mark with 14 saves and a 4.46 ERA in 45 relief appearances last season. The 26-year-old owns an 8-20 career mark with 110 saves and a 2.92 ERA in 278 appearances with the Cardinals.   --Detroit Tigers right-hander Michael Fulmer will miss his scheduled start on Monday after spraining his right ankle during workouts over the weekend.   Fulmer rolled his ankle during agility drills on Saturday, prompting manager Brad Ausmus to announce that he was holding last season's American League Rookie of the Year out of Monday's game against the Baltimore Orioles.   Fulmer posted an 11-7 record with a 3.06 ERA and 132 strikeouts over 159 innings in 26 starts in 2016. The 23-year-old led all AL rookie pitchers in wins and innings pitched last season.",

                      "body": "Since the moment when Kris Bryant gloved Michael Martinez's ground ball and threw across to Anthony Rizzo to end the Cubs' 108-year World Series drought last November, Chicago was installed as the favorite for the 2017 season.   There is plenty of good reason for that projection.   Almost the entire 25-man roster was signed and slated to return for the coming season. The only free agents of concern were outfielder Dexter Fowler, closer Aroldis Chapman and No. 5 starter Jason Hammel.   The offseason is almost entirely played out, and nothing has changed about who is the front-runner.   Chapman signed with the New York Yankees, but the Cubs acquired another first-rate closer, dealing with the Kansas City Royals for Wade Davis and signing Koji Uehara, the former Boston Red Sox closer, as an insurance policy.   Fowler went to the Rockies, but the Cubs signed Jon Jay to share center with impressive rookie Albert Almora.   The signing of free agent Brett Anderson may prove an upgrade from Hammel, who inked a deal with the Royals.   The Cubs filled every hole and also added several starters for organizational depth. The great young core players, Bryant, Rizzo, Addison Russell and Kyle Schwarber, are now experienced and have walked the road to a championship. Why wouldn't the Cubs be the pick?   But this is baseball, and nothing is ever a lock. Some teams spent the offseason \"bulking up\" for a run at Chicago. Others will be healthier. Some will be both.   We've identified five teams that are the biggest threat to a Cubs repeat -- the Cleveland Indians and Boston Red Sox from the American League and the Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Mets and Washington Nationals from the National League -- and explain why they are contenders.LOS ANGELES DODGERS   The Dodgers won 91 games with Clayton Kershaw missing two months to injury. Imagine what they might have been if he stayed healthy. It seems as if the Dodgers' free agents thought that way, too. Several of their key players signed back up even though they had better offers elsewhere -- third baseman Justin Turner, closer Kenley Jansen, No. 2 starter Rich Hill and infielder Chase Utley.   Los Angeles also added second baseman Logan Forsythe and bolstered the bullpen by replacing setup man Joe Blanton with former San Francisco Giants closer Sergio Romo on a free agent deal.   Rookie of the Year Corey Seager should only be better. Right now, 91 wins seems like setting the bar low.BOSTON RED SOX   A significant subtraction and a significant addition marked the Red Sox's offseason after Boston was swept by the Indians in the AL Division Series. Slugger David Ortiz retired after a 38-homer, 127-RBI season. But Boston added a third Cy Young Award contender to its rotation by acquiring Chris Sale in trade from the White Sox. The top of the Red Sox's rotation is now Sale, David Price and 2016 Cy Young winner Rick Porcello.   Boston signed free agent Mitch Moreland to play first base, moving Hanley Ramirez to DH, and the team returns every other position player from the highest-scoring offense in baseball. The Red Sox should get a full year's worth of Andrew Benintendi, who was just anointed Baseball America's top prospect for 2017.   The Sox also made a move to shore up the bullpen behind closer Craig Kimbrel, trading with the Brewers for Tyler Thornburg, who was Milwaukee's closer at the end of last season and had a 2.15 ERA in 67 games.CLEVELAND INDIANS   Cleveland was this close to winning the 2016 World Series, losing Game 7 in extra innings. And that was with two front-of-the-rotation starters -- Danny Salazar and Carlos Carrasco -- unable to start in the postseason and stud outfielder Michael Brantley missing all but 11 games of the season because of shoulder and biceps injuries.   The potential for a healthier Tribe in the postseason is there, plus the Indians made one of the biggest offensive additions of the offseason by signing free agent Edwin Encarnacion. He averaged 39 home runs over the past five seasons and is one of the biggest run-producers in the game. Encarnacion is the highest priced free agent the club has signed.   The offense isn't the only place where Cleveland got stronger. To perhaps the most impressive bullpen end game -- Bryan Shaw, Andrew Miller and Cody Allen -- the Indians added free agent lefty Boone Logan.   One other thing is key: With so many AL Central teams in various rebuilding stages, the Indians have a shot at the best regular-season record, which this season would mean the home-field advantage in the World Series.NEW YORK METS   Top to bottom, the Mets have the scariest rotation in Matt Harvey, Jacob deGrom, Noah Syndergaard, Steven Matz and Zack Wheeler -- but only if that quintet can manage to stay healthy. That's a real question.   The Mets followed their 2015 World Series appearance by reaching the 2016 postseason even though Harvey, deGrom and Matz were all on the disabled list at the end and Wheeler didn't make it back on schedule from Tommy John surgery. None are looking at health concerns going into spring training.   New York also re-signed slugger Yoenis Cespedes, and it returns essentially the entire roster of position players. Jay Bruce struggled after being acquired before the trading deadline, but now the pressure is off. And two other regulars who missed most of the season -- David Wright and Lucas Duda -- should be back, albeit with question marks because of the back issues that sidelined them.   The Mets also re-signed everyone to keep their bullpen intact. Closer Jeurys Familia is likely to be suspended in the early season under Major League Baseball's domestic-violence policy for an incident last October, but setup man Addison Reed has closing experience and should be able to fill in.WASHINGTON NATIONALS   The Nationals entered the past four seasons as a reasonable choice to win the World Series because of the vast talent on the roster. This year is no different, though the window for them to win is growing smaller with the impending free agency of the Bryce Harper and Daniel Murphy two seasons away.   The Nats have an impressive rotation with 2016 Cy Young winner Max Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg and Tanner Roark followed by Gio Gonzalez at No. 4. They added a great table-setter by trading with the White Sox for leadoff man and center fielder Adam Eaton. It makes the batting order very long with Jayson Werth and Ryan Zimmerman potentially batting seventh and eighth respectively.   There is one issue, though, that still may need to be addressed. Washington did not re-sign or replace closer Mark Melancon after the free agent signed with San Francisco. Shawn Kelley goes into spring training as the favorite for the ninth-inning role. The Nationals should have a chance to make a deal, but they need to shore up the back of their bullpen to reach their potential.",

                      "body": "PHOENIX -- Dave Dombrowski must take a vow to outdo himself every winter.   The baseball executive made some of the boldest moves in recent offseasons during his time in Detroit and Boston, and nothing changed this winter.   The man who acquired Miguel Cabrera, Max Scherzer and Yoenis Cespedes for the Tigers and David Price and Craig Kimbrel in his first season with Boston in 2015 juiced up the Red Sox's pitching staff by adding another ace, Chris Sale, the most sought-after trade chip in the winter market.   To a rotation that includes Cy Young (2016 winner Rick Porcello) and Cy Old (Price, 2012), add Cy-to-be. Sale finished in the top five of the AL Cy Young race in each of the past four seasons with the Chicago White Sox while averaging 13 victories, 30 starts, 206 innings and 235 strikeouts.   And the AL East sighs.   Dombrowski, the president of baseball operations in Boston, spent prospects to make the deal, just as he did to land Kimbrel from the San Diego Padres before the start of the 2016 season, taking advantage of Boston's solid drafting and international scouting.   The minors are there to support the major league team, and if that means swapping potential for proven performance, Dombrowski is all in.   The Red Sox will miss the retired David Ortiz, but Sale's arrival should soften the blow for a team that won 93 games but fell in the first round of the playoffs to the Cleveland Indians a year ago.   Other teams are hoping their new additions will help them just as much. Here is a look at the most notable old faces in new places:Edwin Encarnacion, Cleveland Indians   Wondering how Encarnacion's power will play away from the Rogers Centre? Don't. Cleveland's Progressive Field rated as a better hitters' park than the Rogers Centre in both 2015 and 2016, so there is every reason Encarnacion's averages the last four years -- 39 homers, 110 RBIs -- should continue. He was the most productive free agent bat on the market and was said to have preferred staying in Toronto, but when the relationship broke down early in the signing period, Cleveland swooped in.Mark Melancon, San Francisco Giants   The Giants, who made a play for Melancon at the 2016 trade deadline, finally got their man this winter. Melancon was not the sexiest closer in a market that included Kenley Jansen and Aroldis Chapman, but his resume is just a strong -- 33, 51 and 47 saves with a 1.93 ERA the last three seasons. Melancon's ground-ball ratio is well above major league average, and he and is consistent. He failed on 10 save chances the past three years combined. Santiago Casilla blew nine last year.Dexter Fowler, St. Louis Cardinals   There was a not a better fit in free agency than Fowler and St. Louis. The Cardinals needed exactly what Fowler brings, a quality center fielder and a leadoff man. Fowler ranks in top five in the majors in on-base percentage among leadoff hitters since his first full season in Colorado in 2009. Fowler's defense took a major step forward last year when he played a little deeper in center last season. He was credited with 16 runs \"saved\" over the average center fielder.Ian Desmond, Colorado Rockies   Desmond may have been the most creative sign of the offseason, in as much as Colorado plans to play him at first base, a spot he has never played. But if a player can man shortstop and center field, his athleticism qualifies for any spot. Desmond's bat will thicken what looks like a killer offense. He averaged 22 homers, 78 RBIs and 20 stolen bases over the past five years, the first four as Washington's shortstop and the last as Texas' center fielder.Carlos Beltran, Houston Astros   Houston dipped into its history to add a veteran bat by signing Beltran to a one-year, $16 million deal. Beltran helped push Houston into the playoffs in his three months there in 2004, and he was the star of the postseason with eight homers and 14 RBIs in 12 games, a springboard to a seven-year, $119 million deal with the Mets. Beltran will turn 40 in April, but he seems ageless after a 29-homer season with the Yankees and the Rangers a year ago.Wade Davis, Chicago Cubs   How do you replace Chapman? You could do it with a guy who has even better numbers. New closer Davis was nothing short of superb as a setup man-turned-closer in Kansas City the past three seasons. Davis is 19-4 with 47 saves and a 1.18 ERA in 185 relief appearances since the start of 2014. He averaged 11.5 strikeouts while giving up 5.1 hits per nine innings in that run, and he produced a 0.36 postseason ERA as a Royal. The ninth inning remains in good hands.Logan Forsythe, Los Angeles Dodgers   It took the Dodgers all of the offseason, but they finally landed their second base upgrade, acquiring Forsythe in a deal with Tampa Bay that cost frontline pitching prospect Jose De Leon, who averaged 12.1 strikeouts per nine innings in his four minor league seasons. Forsythe leads with his bat and will add pop to an offense that was squarely in the middle of the pack a year ago. He has 37 homers since becoming a regular in 2015 but is considered a below-average defensive second baseman.Kendrys Morales, Toronto Blue Jays   Throw out the 2014 season, when Morales' numbers dipped because a contract holdout that caused him to miss much of spring training. Morales resurrected his career with 52 homers and 199 RBIs in the last two seasons in Kansas City. The Blue Jays found an acceptable alternative to the departed Encarnacion for about half the price, three years and $33 million. Morales regained the form he showed before a devastating knee injury in 2010, and will he slot right into the cleanup spot.Mike Napoli, Texas Rangers   Another ideal free agent fit, although it took the sides awhile to get there. Napoli set career highs with 34 homers, 101 RBIs and 645 plate appearances with Cleveland last season, his age-34 season, an indication he is as \"hitterish\" as ever. In his previous two seasons with Texas, he had 30 and 24 homers in 2011 and 2012, respectively. More of a platoon player then, Napoli will be an everyday guy at first base and designated hitter this time.",

A key component of the deal, considering Eovaldi's health status, is that it includes a club option for the 2018 season.   Eovaldi, a right-hander who turns 27 on Monday, spent the past two seasons with the New York Yankees.   Last season, Eovaldi was 9-8 with a 4.76 ERA in 24 appearances, including 21 starts. In his six years in the major leagues, Eovaldi is 38-46 with a 4.12 ERA.   Elbow injuries ended his 2016 season in August, and he needed surgery on his pitching elbow to repair a torn flexor tendon and partially torn ulnar collateral ligament.   The Rays are expected to put Eovaldi on the 40-man roster and then move him to the 60-day disabled list.

In exchange for Phillips, the Reds received left-handed pitcher Andrew McKirahan and right-hander Carlos Portuondo.   Phillips, 35, is in the final year of a six-year, $72.5 million extension that he signed in 2012. The Reds will pay all but $1 million of the $14 million salary owed to Phillips, according to reports.   \"We are excited to add Brandon Phillips to our club.\" Braves general manager John Coppolella said in a statement. \"He is a Gold Glove-caliber defender who will also deepen our offensive lineup. We are thrilled to 'welcome home' Brandon to Atlanta, where he will play in front of his family and friends and many of his fans.\"   Phillips, a 15-year major league veteran, has played the last 11 seasons in Cincinnati. He is a three-time All-Star and has won four Gold Gloves.   In 2016, Phillips hit .291 with 11 home runs and 64 RBIs in 141 games. He is a career .275 hitter with 197 homers and 889 RBIs.   \"We appreciate Brandon's contributions to our organization,\" Reds general manager Dick Williams said. \"He excited our fan base and was an important part of several seasons of winning Reds baseball. We wish him well with this next opportunity.\"   The Braves wanted Phillips partially due to a left shoulder injury sustained by infielder Sean Rodriguez in a car accident on Jan. 28, according to Fox Sports. Rodriguez will have surgery and is reportedly expected to be out between three and five months.   Phillips waived his no-trade rights to approve the trade to Atlanta. The Braves' GM issued a second statement on Sunday clarifying Phillips' standing with the team.   \"Since John Schuerholz took over as GM in 1991, we have never granted no-trade provisions and we have no intention of changing that policy,\" Coppolella said, adding that \"teams are obligated to honor the contract of players they trade for. \"We will honor Brandon's limited no-trade clause because we are bound to honor the contract provision just as we are bound to honor other contract terms whenever we trade for a player. If Brandon would happen to be traded from the Braves to another team, he would receive a $500,000 assignment bonus. It should be noted that we never included no-trade or limited-trade provisions for players such as Hall of Famers Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz, as well as future Hall of Famers Chipper Jones, Fred McGriff and Andruw Jones, and we have no intention to include these provisions in the future.\"   McKirahan, 27, appeared in 27 games in relief for the Braves in 2015, posting a 5.93 ERA in 27 1/3 innings. He had Tommy John surgery in 2012 and again last year.   Portuondo is a 29-year-old Cuban who signed with the Braves as a free agent in February 2016. His only American experience is 17 appearances and one start between Class A and Triple-A in 2016, going 2-1 with a 3.63 ERA.",

He must pass a physical with the Braves before any transaction can become official.   It wasn't immediately known whom the Reds will receive in the trade.   Phillips batted .291 with 11 homers and 64 RBIs last season. He is a .275 career hitter with 197 homers, 889 RBIs and 198 stolen bases in parts of 15 major league seasons with the Cleveland Indians (2002-05) and the Reds.   Atlanta's urgency to make another run at acquiring Phillips increased when infielder Sean Rodriguez was injured in a car accident in late January. Rodriguez is scheduled to undergo left shoulder surgery next week and is expected to miss 3-to-5 months.",

                      "body": "PHOENIX -- Mookie Betts in 2016.   Bryce Harper in 2015.   Players break out all the time, and this year will be no different.   Naming names is the most difficult part.   Maybe it a player returning to form from an injury. Medical science and the latest rehabilitation tools are remarkable things.   Or a prospect turning his strong initial showing into an everyday occurrence.   Who has adjusted his hitting approach in the offseason?   Who has added or perfected another pitch?   We will find out soon enough. Here is a look at the spring training player to watch for all 30 teams.AMERICAN LEAGUE WESTHouston Astros   Carlos Beltran made his bones in his first stint in Houston in 2004, when he helped the Astros to the NL playoffs after being acquired from Kansas City in June. Beltran made his money after hitting eight postseason homers, signing a seven-year, $119 million deal with the Mets. He returns to the Astros to help fuel another playoff run.Los Angeles Angels   Cameron Maybin is the kind of player who could flourish in Mike Scioscia's system. Maybin recorded 40, 26 and 23 stolen bases in the three seasons in which he played at least 125 games, and Scioscia likes little ball. Maybin slashed a career-high .315/.383/.418 in 94 games with Detroit last year.Oakland A's   Sonny Gray's forearm injury not only limited him to 22 starts and caused a career-high 5.69 ERA last year, but it also deprived the A's of their most dependable starting pitcher. Oakland used 14 starters last year, all of whom made at least five starts. Gray is healthy now, and the A's need him.Seattle Mariners   Since his 19-win 2009 season, Felix Hernandez has been ridden hard and put away wet. Is it catching up to him. He averaged more than 226 innings in the next six seasons after that before a 2016 calf injury limited him to 25 starts, 153 innings and a 3.82 ERA, his highest mark in a decade. How will be recover?Texas Rangers   Jonathan Lucroy identified the Rangers as the best fit for his present and future at the trade deadline last July when he refused a trade to Cleveland, and he was right in the short term, producing 11 homers, 31 RBIs, a .885 OPS in 47 games with the Rangers. His presence all year will be another plus.AMERICAN LEAGUE CENTRALChicago White Sox   Left-hander Jose Quintana has become the de facto ace of the staff after Chris Sale's departure, and he deserves it. Quintana has not missed a start in four years, and he owns a 3.35 ERA and a 1.22 WHIP in that span, good numbers that look even better a hitter's park. It is no wonder teams are after him.Cleveland Indians   Carlos Carrasco really is not fair. His four-pitch mix begins with a 94 mph fastball and includes a slider that according to Fangraphs was one of top eight pitches in getting swinging strikes and ground balls. Terry Francona's brilliant postseason use of Andrew Miller masked Carrasco's absence because of a fractured hand, but Carrasco is healthy again.Detroit Tigers   Wife Kate Upton was right, Justin Verlander was cheated out of the 2016 AL Cy Young Award after a 16-win, 254-strikeout season. Verlander, who turns 34 on Feb. 20, remains the ace of a staff that needs everything it can get out of him. He has subtly changed his repertoire with a little more slider and a little changeup.Kansas City Royals   The Royals had success in resurrecting Kendrys Morales' career, and now they are betting on the upside of Jorge Soler. The right fielder was acquired from the Cubs over the winter for 2018 free-agent-to-be Wade Davis, one of those offseason deals small-market clubs must make. Soler homered once every 19 at-bats last year.Minnesota Twins   Top prospect Byron Buxton, the 2012 No. 2 overall draft pick, has yet to make the splash scouts predicted, which goes to the perils of scouting and the difficulty of the game at the highest level. However, Buxton's power/speed tools have not gone away, and he may be poised to break out in his age-23 season.AMERICAN LEAGUE EASTBaltimore Orioles   Mark Trumbo hit a major-league-high 47 homers last year in a park that suited him perfectly, and it seemed like the perfect jumping off point into free agency. The market did not respond, leaving him little choice but to return for $37.5 million over three years. How will he respond?Boston Red Sox   Pablo Sandoval is penciled in as the Red Sox's starting third baseman entering spring training. Yes, that Sandoval, the one who disappointed in 2015 after signing a five-year, $95 million free agent deal and then missed almost all of last year with a shoulder injury. On the positive side, he can hit, and he is reported to be in shape.New York Yankees   Catcher Gary Sanchez blew up after being promoted in early August, hitting 11 homers in a 15-game span and 20 homers in 53 games overall. The Yankees believe in him, trading Brian McCann in the offseason, and Sanchez worked on his strength during the winter in order to sustain over a full season.Tampa Bay Rays   Matt Duffy was a stealth star in San Francisco's 2014 World Series win, flashing power and a plus glove at third base while finishing second in the Rookie of the Year voting. The principal return for Matt Moore at last year's deadline, Duffy should fit at shortstop, where he spent most of his minor league career.Toronto Blue Jays   Put Devon Travis's first two injury-hampered seasons together and you have a very workable second baseman -- 46 doubles, 19 homers and 85 RBIs in 163 games. Shoulder and issues limited him 2015-16, and he was forced out of the AL Championship Series with a knee injury. Healthy, he enters spring as the top choice to hit leadoff.NATIONAL LEAGUE WESTArizona Diamondbacks   The D-backs opted to scapegoat general manager Dave Stewart and manager Chip Hale for their 2016 struggles, but the late spring injury to A.J. Pollock was the more appropriate culprit. A two-way producer who ranked sixth in the majors in WAR in 2015, Pollock is back after playing only 12 games last year.Colorado Rockies   Rookie shortstop Trevor Story was a walking history lesson last year, tying major league records with 10 homers in April and 10 homers in his first 21 games. Thumb surgery cost him the final two months of the season after he hit 27 dingers in 97 games. He is healthy again, but that will be a tough act to follow.Los Angeles Dodgers   Justin Turner knew exactly how to handle a contract year, setting career marks in virtually every offensive category -- 34 doubles, 27 homers, 90 RBIs -- in his first season as a regular. The Dodgers have to algorithms to believe he can do it again, and they gave him a four-year, $64 million deal as proof.San Diego Padres   The most intriguing name in a mostly retread rotation is right-hander Luis Perdomo, who was thrown into the fire in his age-23 season after joining the Padres in a roundabout Rule 5 move. He throws 94 mph and showed progress after moving into the rotation for good in mid-June.San Francisco Giants   Hunter Pence missed only two games from 2012-14 before injuries limited him the past two seasons. The Giants are solid on offense but not particularly overpowering, and they need Pence's middle-of-the-order bat to be at their best. At 33, it remains to be seen if injuries will persist.NATIONAL LEAGUE CENTRALChicago Cubs   Kyle Schwarber was the feel-good story of the World Series when he returned from a devastating leg injury in time to serve as a designated hitter in the games at Cleveland. Schwarber brings another big bat to a talented roster and another malleable piece for manager Joe Maddon.Cincinnati Reds   A starter in 2015, Cuban free agent Raisel Iglesias was used out in the bullpen when he returned from injury last June after missing two months. He converted six of eight save opportunities when asked to close in August, and he has the stuff to keep the role.Milwaukee Brewers   Right-hander Zach Davies is not physically overpowering at 6 feet, 155 pounds, and his fastball rarely passes 90 mph. However, he has extraordinary command of a four-pitch mix -- the best command in baseball in 2016, according to Baseball Prospectus. He could be ready to take another step up the rotation.Pittsburgh Pirates   Right fielder Gregory Polanco is so athletic -- 6-foot-5, 235 pounds -- it is scary, and he put it all to use in a breakout 2016 season with 34 doubles, 22 homers, 86 RBIs and 17 stolen bases in his age-24 season. A 30-30 season and superstardom await.St. Louis Cardinals   Right-hander Michael Wacha is the Cardinals' nominal No. 5 starter for now, and he has the resume to validate his choice after a 17-victory 2015, his only healthy season in the past three. However, top prospect Alex Reyes is waiting in the wings, and it may be only a matter of time ...NATIONAL LEAGUE EASTAtlanta Braves   Shortstop Dansby Swanson was everything Atlanta believed he would be in his first dip in the major league pool last season, slashing .302/.361/.442 with seven doubles and three homers in 38 games after an August promotion. The first overall pick in the 2015 has All-Star written all over him.Miami Marlins   Right-hander Dan Straily was solid in an under-the-radar manner after the 2016 All-Star break. He won eight of his last 10 decisions and gave up more than three runs only once in 15 second-half starts. On the season, he allowed three or fewer hits in 11 starts, tied for the major league lead.New York Mets   Jose Reyes rehabilitated himself after rejoining the Mets following a two-month suspension last summer, hitting eight homers and stealing nine bases in 60 games. But he played third base, and David Wright is back after missing the better part of two seasons with back issues. How will that play out?Philadelphia Phillies   Shortstop Freddy Galvis was a power hitter and a plus defender in his second season as a regular in 2016, when he hit 20 homers, equaling the number from his first four seasons combined. Which begs the question, what do the Phils do when J.P. Crawford, Baseball America's No. 1 minor league prospect, is promoted?Washington Nationals   Shortstop Trea Turner was a revelation after an early-June promotion last season, and his acquisition as the player to be named in a three-team trade finalized in June 2015 could rank as GM Mike Rizzo's finest deal. Turner amassed 13 homers, 33 stolen bases and a .937 OPS in 73 games. Scary good.",

Tim Anderson went 2-for-3 with a two-run homer in the fifth, while Peter Bourjos added two hits and two runs for Chicago.

Wynston Sawyer snapped a 2-2 tie in the bottom of the seventh with a two-run single for the Dodgers, while Yasmani Grandal contributed a run-scoring single in the first. Greg Allen had an RBI double for the Indians.Royals 3, Rockies 1   Eric Hosmer's two-run homer in a three-run fourth inning was the difference as Kansas City edged Colorado in Surprise, Ariz. Chris Young tossed two scoreless innings as the Royals' starter, while Travis Wood got the win despite allowing Colorado's only run on Charlie Blackmon's RBI single in the fifth. Lorenzo Cain picked up an RBI on a sacrifice fly prior to Hosmer's blast.Athletics 5, Rangers 1   Starter Jesse Hahn worked three scoreless innings, fanning three, as Oakland defeated the Texas in Mesa, Ariz.

Tim Tebow will be available for split-squad Grapefruit League games against the Boston Red Sox on Wednesday and against the Houston Astros on Friday, multiple media outlets reported Sunday.   The outfielder, a former Heisman Trophy winner, reportedly will appear in the Mets' home games each day, which figures to be good for the box office. The Wednesday game is scheduled to air in the New York area on SNY.   USA Today reported that Tebow isn't expected to start either game.   Tebow will get his shot in part due to the World Baseball Classic. The Mets will see 14 players leave their camp in the next few days to join their national teams for the start of the international tournament, leaving vacancies for minor-leaguers to fill.   Tebow made his pro baseball debut last year in the Arizona Fall League, hitting .192 with two RBIs in 19 games.   The 2007 Heisman Trophy winner, Tebow hadn't played baseball since high school before he signed with the Mets last year. He starred as the quarterback of the University of Florida football team from 2006 to 2009, then was a first-round pick of the Denver Broncos in 2010. He made 14 starts for the Broncos in 2010 and 2011 combined, and he guided Denver to a playoff win over the Pittsburgh Steelers in January 2012.   Tebow spent the 2012 season as a backup quarterback with the New York Jets but hasn't appeared in an NFL game since. He subsequently became a college football television analyst before announcing his intention to pursue a baseball career.",

Harvey suffered from thoracic outlet syndrome last year and had not pitched in a game since undergoing surgery to remove a rib in July.   The St. Louis Cardinals scored four runs against Harvey in 1 2/3 innings Sunday in a spring training game at First Data Field in Port St. Lucie, Fla.   Even though he struggled with his fastball command and decreased velocity, Harvey was pleased.   \"Obviously it's been eight months since I played against another team. The biggest thing was going out there and trying, I guess get my mechanics back against another team,\" Harvey told reporters after his outing. \"Today was kind of the first step getting my feet wet in game action and I felt it went pretty well.\"   Harvey allowed a three-run homer and was pulled after getting two outs in the second inning. He struck out three and threw 39 pitches, topping out at 94 mph with his fastball.   In his second season back from Tommy John surgery in 2016 before being shut down, Harvey went 4-10 with a 4.86 ERA in 17 starts. Overall for his career, Harvey is 29-28 with a 2.94 ERA in 82 starts.   --St. Louis Cardinals right-hander Trevor Rosenthal was scratched from Monday's scheduled spring training start against the Minnesota Twins with tightness in his latissimus muscle near his pitching arm.   Rosenthal felt soreness in that area following a one-inning stint against the Washington Nationals on Friday.   \"He's going to need a couple days,\" manager Mike Matheny said of Rosenthal, who came to the majors as a starter before transitioning to the bullpen.   Rosenthal posted a 2-4 mark with 14 saves and a 4.46 ERA in 45 relief appearances last season.

Fulmer rolled his ankle during agility drills on Saturday, prompting manager Brad Ausmus to announce that he was holding last season's American League Rookie of the Year out of Monday's game against the Baltimore Orioles.   Fulmer posted an 11-7 record with a 3.06 ERA and 132 strikeouts over 159 innings in 26 starts in 2016. The 23-year-old led all AL rookie pitchers in wins and innings pitched last season.",
